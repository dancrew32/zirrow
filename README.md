Zirrow
=========

[Zirrow](http://zirrow.danmasq.com) is a Zillow Api wrapper written in Ruby, 
designed to self-document in a Sinatra App.

To get all the gems, `bundle install`

If you just want a really simple Zillow Api class, use `/api/Zirrow.rb`
If you want to run the api site, just `rackup config.ru`
